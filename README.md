# Brain_Tumor_Segmentation
A deep learning based algorithm is presented for brain Tumor segmentation in MRI images. A dataset of MRI images with their ground truth is available on Kaggle to validate performance of the proposed technique.

In this project Im going to segment Tumor in MRI brain Images with a UNET which is based on Keras. The dataset is available online on Kaggle, and the algorithm provided 99.6% accuracy.

Here is the link for accessing to the dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/mateuszbuda/lgg-mri-segmentation
